# GifTastic - Redone
For practice, I built this application out from scratch and included `localStorage`. This app queries the [Giphy api](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) and then dynamically updates the DOM using jQuery. Local storage is used to save your favorites gifs!

To enjoy yourself, follow the below steps:

1. Clone the repo

2. Create a `config.js` file and add the following information:

```
var config = {
    API_KEY: '<your giphy api key>'
}
```
3. Install `animate.css` via npm:

```
$ npm install animate.css --save
```

4. Reference animate.css [documentation](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) should you desire to make changes!
